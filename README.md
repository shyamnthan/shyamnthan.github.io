Welcome to my Landing page! For a quick run-down on any projects I have been working on, and other information you might be interested in, keep scrolling!

## About Me
**I am a data analyst by trade, and I enjoy working on scripting and playing video games!**
I'm an undergraduate in Computer Sciences and Engineering from the National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli. During my time there I served as a deputy manager of the Technical Council, a body of the Student Council in charge of technical and club initiatives. 
On my free time I love listening to music (suggestions you may find later on in this page), playing and hosting tournaments for video-games, makeing detailed analytical reports on things that I love, and learning more about the ever-changing field that is data science. I also love making random designs ~~and I have random obsession with monkeys~~. I curently stay in Atlanta Georgia, working as an Analyst at a start-up based off of California (remotely of course). I am always interested in any analytical opportunities, or just making friends, so feel free to hit me up at any of my social-media platforms!
